         'homeowners are often unwilling to sell their properties and lose '
         'their lower-rate mortgages, further constraining the housing '
         'inventory. Additionally, economic trends such as a strong labor '

         'rises. Higher real incomes boost consumer confidence and purchasing '
         'power, further driving up demand. However, the supply of housing has '
         'not kept pace with this increased demand due to factors such as '
         'labor shortages, land-use regulations, and rising raw material '
         'costs. This mismatch between supply and demand has resulted in '
