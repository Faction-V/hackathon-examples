         'still young and full of magic, there existed two mighty dragons, '
         'each embodying the duality of their kind. The first, Drakos, was a '
         'Western dragon, a colossal beast with scales as hard as diamonds and '
         'breath that could melt the strongest steel. He was feared by all who '
         'knew of him, for his temper was as fiery as the volcanoes he called '
         'home. Drakos guarded a treasure trove of unimaginable wealth, hidden '
         'deep within the molten core of Mount Ignis.", "supporting_answers": '

         'serene lands of the East, lived Shenlong, an Eastern dragon of '
         'immense wisdom and grace. Shenlong was a guardian of the rivers and '
         'the rain, his serpentine body gliding effortlessly through the skies '
         'and waters. Unlike Drakos, Shenlong was revered and worshipped by '
         'the people, who saw him as a benevolent deity. He brought '
         'life-giving rains to the parched lands and protected the villages '

         'Block 4: {"paragraph": "Despite their differences, both dragons '
         'shared a common purpose: to maintain the balance of nature. However, '
         'their methods were as different as night and day. Drakos believed in '
         'the power of fear and strength, while Shenlong believed in wisdom '
         'and harmony. Their paths rarely crossed, but when they did, the '

         'the world. A dark sorcerer, seeking to harness the power of both '
         'dragons, cast a spell that disrupted the natural order. Rivers dried '
         'up, volcanoes erupted uncontrollably, and the skies were filled with '
         'ominous clouds. The people, desperate and afraid, called upon '
         'Shenlong for help. The wise dragon knew that to restore balance, he '

         'dragons, once adversaries, now stood united against a common enemy. '
         'With a mighty roar that shook the heavens, they combined their '
         "powers. Shenlong's control over water and weather tempered Drakos's "
         'fiery wrath, creating a storm of unimaginable power. Together, they '

         'built temples to honor both dragons, recognizing the importance of '
         'balance between strength and wisdom, fear and reverence. Drakos '
