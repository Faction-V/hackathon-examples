         'the responsible development and deployment of artificial '
         'intelligence (AI) technology. He emphasizes the need for security, '
         'transparency, and regulation to mitigate the potential risks posed '
         'by AI, such as misinformation, malware, and phishing. Warner has '
         'consistently urged AI companies to prioritize security and combat '
         'bias, advocating for voluntary commitments to promote safety and '
         'transparency. However, he believes these efforts should be broadened '
         'and extended to include less capable models and additional '
         'safeguards against sensitive misuses like non-consensual image '
         'generation and real-time facial recognition.", "supporting_answers": '

         'the potential misuse of AI systems and has posed critical questions '
         'to ensure AI companies are taking appropriate measures to address '
